# Translation-Workflow

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to implement a reflection-based translation workflow using two different frameworks: LangGraph and Agently Workflow. The workflow involves three main steps:

1.Initial Translation: The text is initially translated from the source language to the target language.

2.Reflection: The translation is reviewed, and constructive suggestions are provided to improve it.

3.Improved Translation: The suggestions are used to produce an improved translation.

By utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) at the core of the translation engine, this system is highly customizable. You can adjust the output style, handle idioms and special terms, and specify regional dialects to better serve a target audience.

## LangGraph Implementation
The LangGraph implementation is in langgraph_workflow.py
# Code Overview

- **Import Libraries**: Import necessary modules and set up the OpenAI client.
- **Define State Structure**: Use a `State` class to manage workflow data.
- **Create Workflow**: Initialize a `StateGraph` object.
- **Define Work Blocks**:
  
  - `initial_translation(state)`: Performs initial translation.
  - `reflect_on_translation(state)`: Provides feedback on the translation.
  - `improve_translation(state)`: Generates the improved translation.

- **Set Up Workflow**: Add nodes and edges to define the workflow sequence.
- **Execute Workflow**: Compile and run the workflow with your source text.

##Agently Workflow Implementation
The LangGraph implementation is in Agently_Workflow_workflow.py
# Code Overview

- **Import Libraries**: Import modules and configure the Agently agent factory.
- **Create Workflow**: Initialize an `Agently.Workflow` object.
- **Define Processing Chunks**:
  
  - `initial_translation(inputs, storage)`: Performs initial translation.
  - `reflect_on_translation(inputs, storage)`: Provides feedback.
  - `improve_translation(inputs, storage)`: Generates the improved translation.

- **Connect Workflow Chunks**: Define the execution flow by connecting chunks.
- **Add Output Handling**: Implement a chunk to display results at each stage.
- **Start Workflow**: Run the workflow with your source text.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how reflection-based workflows can enhance translation quality using LLMs and frameworks like LangGraph and Agently. It provides a customizable approach that can potentially outperform traditional machine translation systems.
